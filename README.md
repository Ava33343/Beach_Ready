## **Sailing for An Early Retirement!**
_**Option 1: Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans**_

A bot **RoboAdvisor** is built for retirement planning on Amazon Lex.


### _**Demo:**_

_**Scenario 1: when the provided age falls between 0 and 65 with an investment of at least $5000**_

_**Scenario 2: when investing less than $5000 or the age provided falls outside the range of 0 to 65**_

### _Details_

Two more utterances are added to those provided in the [instructions](Instructions/README.md) as follows:
* How to retire early and take ​{riskLevel}​ risk
* I need ​{investmentAmount}​ by ​{age}​ to retire

Recommendations are built under the `recommend_portfolio(intent_request)` function as follows:

```python
    """
    Performs dialog management and fulfillment for recommending a portfolio.
    """
    risk_level = get_slots(intent_request)["riskLevel"]
```

```python
    # define investment portfolio recommendations

"""
    Responses based on selected risk levels.
    """
    risk = {
        "None": "100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)",
        "Very Low": "80% bonds (AGG), 20% equities (SPY)",
        "Low": "60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)",
        "Medium": "40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)",
        "High": "20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)",
        "Very High": "0% bonds (AGG), 100% equities (SPY)"
    }
```

with initial recommendation
```python
# Get the initial investment recommendation
    initial_recommendation = risk[risk_level]
```

## **Next Steps**

* _**Construct post-confirmation intents using `get_slots` on `riskLevel` responses. In the current version, the `Confirmation Prompt` box was unchecked on Amazon Lex intent builder as it "short-circuit" the trigger to select `riskLevel`.**_ 
    * If ordering becomes an issue, define a separate function `recommended_portfolios(risk)` shown below could be an alternative to the current risk dictionary defined under the function `recommend_portfolio(intent_request)`:
<details><summary>
Click me for details on an alternative function:
</summary>

```python
 # define investment portfolio recommendations
def recommended_portfolios(risk):
"""
Responses based on selected risk levels.
"""
risk = {
    "None": "100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)",
    "Very Low": "80% bonds (AGG), 20% equities (SPY)",
    "Low": "60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)",
    "Medium": "40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)",
    "High": "20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)",
    "Very High": "0% bonds (AGG), 100% equities (SPY)"
    }
    return risk[risk_level]
```
It follows that the `initial_recommendation` defined under the current `recommend_portfolio(intent_request)` function becomes:
```python

# Get the initial investment recommendation
    initial_recommendation = recommended_portfolios(risk)
```
</details>

* _**Add additional slots to respond based on feedbacks**_
    * Allow customers to go back and re-select their risk levels
    * Provide more customized recommendations, e.g. more variety under each `riskLevel`


* _**Deploy RoboAdvisor on Facebook or Slack on `Channels` tab using Amazon Lex Documentations**_
    * Graphic analyzers are available under `Monitoring` tab on Lex
